# Impermanent Filesystem
#
# Odin follows an "Erase your Darlings" impermanent filesystem structure, powered by an encrypted ZFS filesystem and subvolumes.
# Every boot the system performs a rollback of the ZFS root filesystem to a clean snapshot in order to prevent the buildup of state.
#
# Everything should either be generated from this repo's flake, stored in /persistent or stored on the data drives
#
# The filesystem setup was already handled by nixos-anywhere and disko during installation. These settings are merely responsible for
# implementing the rollback and setting up persistent storage using impermanence as well as mounting the data drives
#
# See https://mt-caret.github.io/blog/posts/2020-06-29-optin-state.html
