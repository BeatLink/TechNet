# Odin

A gaming laptop that acts as my daily driver.

Odin uses NixOS as its main operating system for general purposes. The root filesystem is on an encrypted 256GB M.2 NVMe Drive while files and settings for all applications are stored on an encrypted 1TB M.2 NVMe Drive. A 1TB 2.5 in SSD hosts a Windows 11 dual boot installation for gaming and university activities.
