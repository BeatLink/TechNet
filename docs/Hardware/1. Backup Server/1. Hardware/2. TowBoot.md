# Tow-Boot

The bootloader for Ragnarok is U-Boot built using tow-boot. As my current SBC is not equipped with an SPI flash, the Tow-Boot shared disk image was installed to a 32 GB SD Card. This is to allow the device to boot any UEFI aarch64 ISO or drive without specific imaging and structures on an SD card. All of the required code can be found here: https://github.com/BeatLink/Tow-Boot/tree/rock64

## Installation

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/BeatLink/Tow-Boot -b rock64`
2. Run `nix-build --arg src ./Tow-Boot -A pine64-rock64`
3. Run `dd if=shared.disk-image.img of=/dev/XXX bs=1M oflag=direct,sync status=progress`
