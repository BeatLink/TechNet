# Thor X

Thor X is a PinePhone smartphone that's intended as my alternate phone and experimental mobile computing platform. Hopefully it, or an upgraded version may replace my daily driver.

Odin uses NixOS as its main operating system. The root filesystem is on a zfs encrypted partition on the built in eMMC chip while a 128 GB SD Card holds the TowBoot bootloader partition and an encrypted ZFS data partition for storing files and settings for all applications.

### Tow-Boot

The bootloader for Thor X is Tow Boot. As the PinePhone is not equipped with an SPI flash, the Tow-Boot shared disk image is installed to the SD card used for shared storage. This is to allow the device to boot any UEFI aarch64 ISO or drive without specific imaging and structures on the eMMC card.

#### Installation

1. Run [./scripts/flash-sd-card.sh](./scripts/flash-sd-card.sh)
