### Tow-Boot

The bootloader for Ragnarok is U-Boot built using tow-boot. As my current SBC is not equipped with an SPI flash, the Tow-Boot shared disk image was installed to a 32 GB SD Card. This is to allow the device to boot any UEFI aarch64 ISO or drive without specific imaging and structures on an SD card. All of the required code can be found here: https://github.com/BeatLink/Tow-Boot/tree/rock64

#### Installation

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/BeatLink/Tow-Boot -b rock64`
2. Run `nix-build --arg src ./Tow-Boot -A pine64-rock64`
3. Run `dd if=shared.disk-image.img of=/dev/XXX bs=1M oflag=direct,sync status=progress`

## NixOS

### Notes

- Rock64 may not function with direct connection to certain monitors. Utilize a Xtech HDMI to VGA adapter to bypass this
- For Serial setup:

  - Connect the wires as follows
    - Black - GND
    - White - RXD
    - Bown - TXD
  - Run `nix-shell -p minicom`

2. Write it to a usb drive
3. Format a fast SSD drive with a linux swap partition using Gparted
4. Disconnect all other drives from the SBC
