# Cinnamon Settings
#
# This module configures all the settings for the Cinnamon Desktop Environment. Cinnamon settings are stored in dconf-settings.nix. 
# It is automatically generated by export-dconf-settings.sh so you can change the cinnamon settings then export the changes without editing
# the file manually.
